> This guide will help users set up a supabase account to work inside of SurveyDown 
for quick & live server updates

# Step 1: Creating your account.

<p style="font-size: 18px;"> To begin your database setup that involves creating an account on the [supabase](https://supabase.com/) website.
</p>

# Step 2: Creating your account.

<p style="font-size: 18px;"> 
From the Main page, select "Start your Project" underlined in <span style="color:red; text-decoration:underline;"> red</span>.
</p>

# Step 3: Creating your database.

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
After creating your new account proceed to your dashboard, and select "New Project"
</p>

<img src="images/main_pageS3.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

# Step 4: Creating your database.

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
The next step is to create your respective database, be sure to take note of the database password as this will be needed later on.
</p>

<img src="images/main_pageS4.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

# Step 5: Finding our DB parameters.

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
While on your project dashboard select the settings gear in the bottom left.
</p>

<img src="images/main_pageS5.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

# Step 6: Finding our DB parameters.

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
Select "Database" under configuration.
</p>

<img src="images/main_pageS6.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

# Step 7: Finding our DB parameters.

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
Take note of all the of the connection parameters, as well as the database password in Step 4.
</p>

<img src="images/main_pageS7.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

# Step 8: Taking a look at the sd_database() function.

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
Now that we've created our database and have gotten all the needed parameters we can now connect the database to our survey.
Taking a look at our code inside of our **survey.qmd** file you may notice the 6 parameters, 5 of which we've discovered earlier. The last parameter would be "table_name", this parameter can be any name of your choosing. </p>

*Note: All parameters currently listed as NULL must be wrapped in quotes when replaced.*

```{r}
#| eval: false

# surveydown stores data on a database that you define at https://supabase.com/
# To connect to a database to store the survey data, update this with details
# from your supabase account and database. See documentation for details.
# For security, we recommend storing your supabase password in your R
# environment instead of hard-coding it here, which you can open and edit with
# usethis::edit_r_environ()

 db <- sd_database(
   host       = NULL,
   db_name    = NULL,
   port       = NULL,
   user       = NULL,
   table_name = NULL,
   password   = Sys.getenv("SUPABASE_PASSWORD")
 )

# If you don't have a database setup you can just leave the function blank.

db <- sd_database()

```

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
As you may also notice db is defined twice. After putting in your parameters in their respective places make sure to delete the line:
</p>

```{r}
#| eval: false

db <- sd_database()

```

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
You may also notice that our **password** parameter is hidden inside of our R environment. This is for security reasons and is recommended.
</p>

# Step 9: Putting the dasebase Password inside of the R env.

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
This step shows how to put your database password inside of the R environment. 
</p>

## First: Open the R environment.

This should open up a new R tab called *".Renviron"*
```{r}
#| eval: false
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

## Second: Edit R environment.

Add in your database password. 

*Note: This does not need to be wrapped in quotes*


SUPABASE_PASSWORD=######

## Third: Restart your R session

This can be done by going to *"Session"* -> *"Restart R"* or by doing the shortcut *"Cmd + Shift + 0"* on Mac.

# Step 10: Bringing it all together.

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
Now that we have our password secure and all other parameters we can update our sd_database() function from Step 8 to look like this:
</p>


```{r}
#| eval: false

 db <- sd_database(
   host       = "aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com", #This varies based on location,
                                                       #check Step 7.
   db_name    = "postgres", # For the purpose of supabase, this will always be "postgres".
   port       = "####", # Your 4 digit port number from Step 7.
   user       = "postgres.UserValue", # This is the User parameter from Step 7.
   table_name = "What Ever Name You Want", # This is what your table name will be.
   password   = Sys.getenv("SUPABASE_PASSWORD") #Database password - Steps 4 and 9.
 )

```

# Tada!!!

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
Going back to your Project dashboard and selecting *"Table Editor"* on the left hand bar tab you should see your table appear once your survey is run and interacted with atleast once.
