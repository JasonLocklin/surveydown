Description: Generate surveys using markdown and R code chunks. Surveys are defined as Quarto shiny documents that render to shiny apps. Survey data collected from respondents is stored in a supabase database. Features include controls for conditional skip logic (skip to a page based on an answer to a question), conditional display logic (display a question based on an answer to a question), the ability to export time stamps (both for each page and each question interaction), a customizable progress bar, and a wide variety of question types, including multiple choice (single choice and multiple choices), select, text, numeric, multiple choice buttons, text area, and dates.
