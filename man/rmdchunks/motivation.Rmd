Most survey platforms (e.g., Google forms, Qualtrics, etc.) use graphic interfaces to design surveys, making version control and collaboration with others difficult. They're also not easily reproducible, and many require a paid subscription or license to use.

The surveydown package was designed to address these problems. As an open-source, markdown-based platform, all survey content is defined with plain text (markdown and R code) in a `survey.qmd` file and an `app.R` file that renders your survey into a Shiny app that can be hosted online. This makes your survey easy to reproduce, share, and version control with common tools like Git. The researcher also has total control over the data collected as it is stored in a PostgreSQL database of their choosing (we recommend Supabase as a free and secure option).

If you're curious where this whole idea came from, check out this [blog post](https://www.jhelvy.com/blog/2023-04-06-markdown-surveys/), which outlines more on the general idea and the motivation for it. The post is now outdated in terms of the overall package design, but it provides something of an origin story and some of the motivation for developing this project.
