This is a prototype of a way to create surveys using [Quarto shiny documents](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/interactivity/shiny-r.html).

If you want to try running the demo, download the [fences branch](https://github.com/jhelvy/surveydown/tree/fences), open the surveydown.Rproj file to open RStudio, then open the survey.qmd file. You should just be able to click the "Run Document" button at the top. You need to have the {shiny} and {shinyjs} packages installed.

If you want to run it using just the command line, clone the fences branch then follow instructions [here](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/shiny/running.html).
