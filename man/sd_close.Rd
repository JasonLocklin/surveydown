\title{Create a 'Close' Button to Exit the Survey}
\usage{
sd_close(label = "Exit Survey")
}
\arguments{
\item{label}{Character string. The label of the 'Close' button. Defaults to "Exit Survey".}
}
\value{
A Shiny tagList containing the 'Close' button UI element and associated JavaScript for the exit process.
}
\description{
This function creates a 'Close' button that, when clicked, will trigger the exit process
for the survey. Depending on the server-side configuration, this may show a rating question
or a simple confirmation dialog before attempting to close the current browser tab or window.
}
\details{
The function generates a Shiny action button that, when clicked, triggers the 'show_exit_modal' event.
The server-side logic (controlled by the \code{rate_survey} parameter in \code{sd_server()}) determines
whether to show a rating question or a simple confirmation dialog.

The function also includes a custom message handler for closing the window. This is necessary
because some browsers may not allow JavaScript to close windows that were not opened by JavaScript.
In such cases, the user will be prompted to close the tab manually.
}
\note{
The actual behavior of the exit process (whether to show a rating question or not)
is controlled by the \code{rate_survey} parameter in the \code{sd_server()} function, not in this UI function.
