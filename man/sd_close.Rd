This function creates a 'Close' button that, when clicked, will prompt for confirmation
before attempting to close the current browser tab or window.
The button can be activated by clicking or by pressing the Enter key when visible.
}
\details{
The function generates a Shiny action button that, when clicked, displays a confirmation dialog.
If confirmed, it attempts to close the current browser tab or window. Note that for security reasons,
some browsers may not allow JavaScript to close windows that were not opened by JavaScript.
In such cases, the button will prompt the user to close the tab manually.
