# surveydown (development version)

# surveydown 0.0.3

- Now `show_if` can be applied to multiple options of the same question, which allows users to have more than one option in a question that triggers the revealing of a hidden question.
- Now if the "required" question is hidden, it will not trigger the page warning of "not all questions are answered".
- Now users can have a page with the same name of its ID and its header, regardless of capitalization. For example, users can now have a page ID being "#educational", and its header being "#Educational". This sounds as it should be, but in previous versions, the page hiding logic will show bug if page ID is the same as page header.

# surveydown 0.0.2

- Support added for the `required` argument in `sd_question()`, which allows users to force a question to be required. If not answered, a popup window blocks the user from continuing to the next page.
- The supabase backend is now connected and documentation on how to set up the database is complete.
- Initial setup for tests added
