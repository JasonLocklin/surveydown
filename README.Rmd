> Note: This site only documents the {surveydown} R package - visit our main site at [surveydown.org](https://surveydown.org) for more information!

**surveydown** is a flexible, open-source platform for making surveys with [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/), and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

  <img src='man/figures/technologies.png' width="550px" alt="image showing the three technologies used in the surveydown platform along with their logos: quarto (for designing surveys), shiny (for rendering the survey), and supabase (for storing data)"/>
</div>
<br>

The basic concept is:

1. Design your survey as a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) document using markdown and R code.
2. Convert your survey into a [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app that can be hosted online and sent to respondents.
3. Store your survey responses in a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) database (or any Postgres database).

The {surveydown} R package provides functions to bring this all together.

**See the [documentation](https://surveydown.org) to get started making your own surveydown survey!**
