**surveydown** is a flexible, open-source platform for making surveys with [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/), and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

Here's how it works:

1. Design your survey as a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) document using markdown and R code.
2. Render your survey into a [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app that can be hosted online and sent to respondents.
3. Store survey responses in a PostgreSQL database - we recommend [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as a free, secure, and easy to use option.

The {surveydown} R package provides functions to bring this all together.
