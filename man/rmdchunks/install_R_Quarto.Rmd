You need both: 

- Install [R](https://CRAN.R-project.org/)
- Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

We also recommend working with an IDE that has good support for R, Quarto, and Shiny.

[RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) is great, and we also like [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) and [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron).
